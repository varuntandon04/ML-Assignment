# ML-Assignment

The assignment provided two data files for use in training and validating your models: train.csv and test.csv. Each row in these two files corresponds to a single blight ticket, and includes information about when, why, and to whom each ticket was issued. The target variable is compliance, which is True if the ticket was paid early, on time, or within one month of the hearing data, False if the ticket was paid after the hearing date or not at all, and Null if the violator was found not responsible. Compliance, as well as a handful of other variables that will not be available at test-time, are only included in train.csv.  

The goal is to find the probability that the corresponding blight ticket will be paid on time.  

The evaluation metric for this assignment is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC).
